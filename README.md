Programming Assignment 6 from Programming and Problem Solving I (CSC120 at the University of Mount Union)

This program draws a scene of an apple tree with a figure of 
Isaac Newton holding a basket. As the buttons are clicked, the
apples move down the screen and the task is to capture them in
the basket. If more than 3 apples reach the ground, then the game
is over.
